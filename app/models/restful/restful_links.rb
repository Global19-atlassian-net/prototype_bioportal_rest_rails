require 'cgi'

# Provides a mechanism to create relationships between objects or declare related paths, which are used to generate
# hypermedia links for use in the API.
#
# To use, add the following to your target class:
#   class SubResource
#     resource_path "/resource/:parent_resource/sub/:sub_resource"
#   end
# The segments of the path that start with ":" should correspond to either the class name for the class you are
# declaring for or methods on the class that will return appropriate ids.
#
# To declare related classes, do the following:
#   class SubResource
#     related_resources :resource => Resource, :another => "/path/:sub_resource"
#   end
# Any related resources that are declared using the related class and not a string must also have the resource_path declared.
#
# Objects using this API will need to have the following methods:
#  1. 'id', which outputs the id for the instance of the object. This is used to insert the id into the path.
#  2. Any other segments starting with ":" should have a corresponding instance method.
